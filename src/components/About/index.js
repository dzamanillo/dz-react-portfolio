			<h3>Adapt. Optimize. Grow.</h3>
			<p>
				I am a web developer focused on helping people do just that. My mission
				to prioritize these values that have made an impact on me both
				professionally and personally. I have immersed myself in learning and
				have developed a healthy obsession with finding that next “a-ha!”
				moment. My experience as a Production Sound Mixer has taught me how to
				work within a team to accomplish a common goal. I hope to blend the
				knowledge of my past, with the skills of my future, to help you achieve
				your vision.
